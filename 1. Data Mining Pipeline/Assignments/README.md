Welcome to programming assignments. Here are some instructions to follow while attempting to solve the assignment.

The assignment is set up through a Jupyter Notebook environment. The work in browser button on the assignment page should open the Jupyter Notebook in a new browser tab.

Do not install any python packages that are not part of the coursera data science docker image.

Few parts of the assignment are auto-graded and we request you to validate your code with the hidden test cases before submission.

You are allowed multiple submissions for this assignment before the deadline.

Each question in the notebook is preceded with a rubric on how to approach the questions. Please make sure to follow the function signatures wherever necessary.
