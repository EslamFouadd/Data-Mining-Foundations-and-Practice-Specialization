Launch Your Career in Data Science. Master core data mining concepts, techniques, and hands-on skills.

# Specialization - 3 course series
The Data Mining specialization is intended for data science professionals and domain experts who want to learn the fundamental concepts and core techniques for discovering patterns in large-scale data sets. This specialization consists of three courses: (1) Data Mining Pipeline, which introduces the key steps of data understanding, data preprocessing, data warehouse, data modeling and interpretation/evaluation; (2) Data Mining Methods, which covers core techniques for frequent pattern analysis, classification, clustering, and outlier detection; and (3) Data Mining Project, which offers guidance and hands-on experience of designing and implementing a real-world data mining project.

Data Mining can be taken for academic credit as part of CU Boulder’s Master of Science in Data Science (MS-DS) degree offered on the Coursera platform. The MS-DS is an interdisciplinary degree that brings together faculty from CU Boulder’s departments of Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, Information Science, and others. With performance-based admissions and no application process, the MS-DS is ideal for individuals with a broad range of undergraduate education and/or professional experience in computer science, information science, mathematics, and statistics.

# Applied Learning Project

There are programming assignments that cover specific aspects of the data mining pipeline and methods. Furthermore,  the Data Mining Project course provides step-by-step guidance and hands-on experience of formulating, designing, implementing, and reporting of a real-world data mining project.
